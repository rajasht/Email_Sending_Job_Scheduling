1. TO SEND SCHEDULED EMAIL TO RANDOM USER, IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO ADD CODE IN WEB.PHP ROUTE.
2. TO SEND SCHEDULED EMAIL TO RANDOM USER USING MAILTRAP FIRST OF ALL WE NEED TO DO SOME MODIFICATION IN .ENV FILE

WE SHOULD HAVE A DATABASE HAVING ANY TABLE HAVING COLUMN NAME email in it.

--------------------------------------------
APP_NAME="SENDER'S NAME"
-------------------------------------------
DB_DATABASE=Email_Job_Operation_DB
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=PASSWORD
-------------------------------------------
QUEUE_CONNECTION=database
-------------------------------------------
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.mailtrap.io
MAIL_PORT=2525
MAIL_USERNAME=1234sfhakf1212
MAIL_PASSWORD=1234sakkasjsla3
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="any_email_id"
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
-------------------------------------------

NOW we need to make a mail and view....we use laravel's default markdown by executing the command in terminal:

==> php artisan make:mail "Mail_php_file_name" --markdown="View_folder_name"."view_blade_php_file_name"

The above command will create a view file inside Resources/views/View_folder_name/view_blade_php_file_name
and a phpmail file inside App\Mail\Mail_php_file_name.

Now after required lines of code for the operation, run the following command in terminal :

==> php artisan make:model "Model_name"

The above command should have Model name same as table name in Singular term and having first letter in Uppercase.
the execution of above command creates a model Model_name in App\Models. (at present no need to do here anything.)

Now to Create Job we need to create a queue migration of name jobs, and for that run the command :

==> php arisan queue:table

it will create a jobs table in the database/migrations/21437178_create_jobs_table.php

Now to migrate it run the command :

==> php artisan migrate

The above command will create jobs table in the database.

Now we need to create Job for our operation, and to do so, first we need to run below command:

==> php artisan make:job "job_name"

The execution of above command will result creation of job_name file in App/Jobs folder.

Now after writing code in Jobs...we need to open app/Console/Kernel.php file

Under Schedule function we can write our Job scheduling and command Scheduling code for sending email.

After writing Just Run the below command to make it executable :

==> php artisan schedule:work

This will run the email sending task as per schedule.
